Blasphemy in the Islamic religion is similar in many ways to Christian blasphemy, but in other ways, contrasts sharply away from that of Christianity. Some of the similar ways to blaspheme would be speaking negatively about any of the prophets found in the Quran, or that there are any other gods, or, to say that Jesus Christ, (son of Mary and Joseph) is the son of God. However, it’s not blasphemy, (such as it is in Christianity) to use interjections such as “God!”, “Oh my God!”, for example, as expletives. It’s blasphemy instead, if you were to say, “Jesus” or “Holy Crap!” because it denotes worship to something other than God. There are several different verses within the Quran that deal with blasphemy, such as:

“When ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme. [Qur’an 4:140]”

“And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: “to us our deeds and to you yours; peace be to you. [Qur’an 28: 55]”

“Hold to forgiveness, command what is right; but turn away from the ignorant. [Qur’an 7:199]”

The thing is, when reviewing the different verses found in the Quran that speak out about blasphemy, many of them contradict Muslim laws against blasphemy. Usually, being found guilty of blasphemy in the Islamic religion means either life imprisonment or execution. However, these lines from the Quran suggest that there should be no earthly sentencing for blasphemy. Blasphemy in Muslim religion is a sin; if a Muslim individual was to die before they had repented the sin of blasphemy, they would not be able to enter into Heaven. This comes from what is stated in the Quran; “He forgives all sins, except disbelieving in God (blasphemy)”.
