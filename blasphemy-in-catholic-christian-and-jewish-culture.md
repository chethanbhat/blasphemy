Blasphemy is thought of in many different ways by different Christian denominations, such as Catholic, Baptists, etc. Blasphemy, disrespect of God or the Torah is condemned entirely in the Jewish religion. The Torah states that anyone found guilty of committing blasphemy “shall surely be put to death,” as per the third book of the Torah, in Leviticus 24:16. There are several other capital crimes in the Torah as well, such as prostitution, disobedience to one’s parents, murder, sacrifices to Molech (a bull god who supposedly eats children, otherwise thought to be a demon). The list goes on and on. Suffice to say, that you had to be a particularly good person to be a Jew in ancient times.

In Christianity, forms of blasphemy are sometimes disputed, but many sources agree that it is an “eternal sin.” In Luke 12:10 the sin of blasphemy is spoken of as unforgivable. However, there are no actual definitions of what blasphemy is, or how it’s punishable in the different Biblical and apocryphal books. When the Christian religion was still emerging, and in the time of Christ, blasphemy and warning against blasphemy, may have been thought of as warnings. Awareness against the possibility that the deity might create a direct action against the individual that spoke out against Him, such as a curse, or being “struck dead by lightning.”

In the Catholic religious denomination of Christianity, individuals are able to make reparation prayers to be forgiven for the sin of blasphemy. The prayers were introduced first by Sister Marie of St Peter in 1844, one example being The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion, that was eventually approved by the Pope Leo XIII in 1885. The Catholic Raccolta prayer book contains a number of such prayers, that can be spoken aloud and repeated as reparations for blasphemy.
